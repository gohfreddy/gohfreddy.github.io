                    <p>A 'term' refers to school term which reoccur every 4 months. Every year, there are three terms (Winter, Spring, Fall). The badminton club operates every term and therefore registers a new set of members (up to 300 members) and hires a new exec team (approximately 20 execs and 5 directors) every term.</p>
                    <p>In short, fewer execs are returning to the club. Execs typically help with setup, cleanup, arranging games, and handling member requests during session; are traditionally compensated  with: shirts, social events, food, and an end-of-term dinner. This position is completely voluntary.</p>

                    <p>A pilot was performed in the previous term (Fall 2016). Execs were split into teams and were assigned points for any positive actions throughout the term. This was meant to be fun and slightly competitive to motivate execs (original concept comes from point assignments to different houses in Harry Potter).</p>

                    <p>This system promoted teamwork and was a good 'excuse' to recognize and reward good behaviour. The major issue was the lack of a meaningful scoring system since any director could award points to any exec for practically any reason. It was subjective and bias.</p>

                    <p>Does the exec recognition system (ERS) solve the problem?</p>
                    <p>Does the ERS address exec retention by recognizing and appreciating execs for their efforts?</p>
                    <img src="img/uwbc_ers_casestudy/RetentionGraph_vector_2017.png" alt="Updated Retention Graph" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
                     <p class="figure-caption">Year-to-year retention rates (includes 2016 to 2017 exec data)</p>
                    <p>Between 2016 and 2017, there was a high of 36.2% retention. Recurring interest in the club exec positon increased, but it would be impossible to say that it was a product of the ERS. </p>
                    <p>After this experiment, I can say that exec appreciation and recognition goes beyond points, badges, and leaderboards (PBL). The PBL was a fun way to quantitatively track individual exec performance, provide more opportunities to host fun/competitive events, and give out rewards.</p>
                    <p class="list-header">Important components of this system includes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Verbal Feedback</strong>: for good and poor performance. Genuine words of affirmation can be worth more than a tangible reward and goes a long way.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Events</strong>: presented as team competition and demanded teamwork and team cohesion but more importantly, they cultivated a fun environment.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If an exec feels that their efforts are appreciated and at the same time able to create fun memories, I think it's a step forward in retaining execs who are intrinsically motivated to stay term after term.</p>

                    <p>One <strong>limitation</strong> during the research phase was the ability to diagnose the real reason execs had for discontinuing their service with the available data. It would have been nice to complete exit interviews or start doing exit interviews with execs.</p>
                    <p>Logistically, other directors mentioned that it was extra effort for them to update points and maintain a system like ERS on top of regular club operations.</p>
                    <p>The successful components of ERS include: teams, organized exec events, rewards, and feedback. The sense of being a part of a team allow new execs to have a support system to fall upon. Organized exec events should encourage teamwork. Rewards and verbal feedback are also important elements to reassure execs that they are valued. I am not sure how these components will work without PBLs but I look forward to the future of UWBC.</p>
